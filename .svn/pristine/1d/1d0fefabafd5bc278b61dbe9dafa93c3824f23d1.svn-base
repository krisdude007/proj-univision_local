        <strong>Notice To California Residents – Your California Privacy Rights:</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="color:#636363">
        Effective January 1, 2005, under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (known as the "<strong>Shine the Light</strong>" law), if an individual who is a
        California resident has provided personal information to a business in connection with a business relationship that is primarily for personal, family, or
        household purposes, and if that business has within the immediately preceding calendar year disclosed such an individual's personal information to a
        third-party and knows or should have known that such third-party used the information for its own direct marketing purposes, then that business is
        obligated to disclose in writing to such individual upon request, what personal information was shared and with whom it was shared. A business may comply
        with this law by: (1) having EITHER a published privacy policy of not sharing a customer's personal information for third-parties' direct marketing use
        unless the customer has first affirmatively opted in to such sharing OR a published privacy policy of not sharing a customer's personal information for
        third-parties' direct marketing use if the customer has opted out to prevent his/her personal information from being shared for direct marketing use; AND
        (2) notifying the customer of his/her right to opt out and providing a cost-free means for the customer to exercise that right.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#636363">
        Any request for a disclosure required under this law should be sent to us via email at    <a href="mailto:caprivacy@correo.univision.com"><u>caprivacy@correo.univision.com</u></a>. Please note that under this law, we are not required to respond
        to a customer's request more than once in a calendar year, nor are we required to respond to any request that is not sent to the email address designated
        above.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#636363">
        California residents may also learn how Univision responds to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals. As the technology is evolving for recognizing and interpreting
        DNT signals, and no uniform standard has yet been set, Univision is not currently responding to DNT signals but remains open to following the technological
        standards once those are issued.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#636363">
        <strong>1. <u>Types of Information We Collect</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p style="color:#636363">
        <strong><em>Personally Identifiable Information</em></strong>
        (or <strong>"PII"</strong>) is any information that can identify or is linked to a specific individual, such as your name, mailing address, telephone
        number (including mobile number), email address, credit card number, debit card number, bank account number, and other financial account information, birth
        date, gender, occupation, personal interests, demographic, location and household information, etc. To the extent you voluntarily provide your PII to us,
        we collect such information. For example, we may collect PII from you (to the extent permitted by law): (1) when you sign up for one of our products or
        services, such as when you join one of our online communities (including the social networking areas on Univision.com and our fan pages on third-party
        social media sites); (2) when you join one of our mailing or contact lists; (3) when you register to participate in an event sponsored by us (such as a
        contest, sweepstakes, giveaway, promotion, survey, concert, festival, community fair, etc.); (4) when you enter into a transaction with us, such as
        ordering a product from us through our online store; (5) when you use or interact with a product or service of the Univision Interactive Network; (6) when
        you provide or share information using a product or service of the Univision Interactive Network; (7) when you send information via message, chat, blog,
        post or similar functionality using a product or service of the Univision Interactive Network; (8) when you create, share or link personal profile using a
        product or service of the Univision Interactive Network, including linking or associating your profile on a third-party site or platform with your
        Univision account; and/or (9) when you submit a request or inquiry to us via the Univision Interactive Network or otherwise (each of the foregoing is
        referred to hereinafter as an <strong>"Identification Activity"</strong>).
    </p>
    <p style="color:#636363">
        It is optional for you to engage in an Identification Activity. However, if you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, we may ask you for certain
        PII. Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide may be identified as mandatory and some may be identified as optional. If you
        do not provide the mandatory information for a particular Identification Activity that requires it, you will not be able to engage in that activity. In
        addition, if you use the Univision Interactive Network to send information to another person (e.g., a friend, a family member, etc.), we will also collect
        PII of that other person to the extent disclosed by you. We also collect the username and password for the email account you wish to import your contacts
        from, for example, and will only use it for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#636363">
        <strong><em>Aggregate and Anonymous Information</em></strong>
        (hereinafter <strong>"AAI"</strong>) is any information that cannot identify or be linked to a specific individual. For example, we may collect anonymous
        group data (demographics, media habits, online browsing habits, interests and preferences, etc.) about viewers and listeners of our television and radio
        programs, participants of our sponsored events and activities, users and members of the Univision Interactive Network, etc. (hereinafter referred to
        collectively as <strong>"our Audiences"</strong>). We also collect aggregate traffic data pertaining to the Univision Interactive Network, such as: total
        page views in a given time period; total impressions per ad; average amount of time that visitors spend on the Univision Interactive Network (or a part
        thereof) each time they visit; average amount of time that visitors spend on each page of any one or more parts of the Univision Interactive Network;
        percentage of visitors from a certain geographical area, etc. Moreover, we may combine "User Activity Information" (as described below) about you and other
        users of the Univision Interactive Network to generate aggregate information that reflects activities, habits, preferences, interests, etc. about our users
        as a group. We also collect location-based information such as zip code, city and state name. In addition, we may take PII and make it non-personally
        identifiable, such as by aggregating your information with information about other individuals, or by removing personally-identifiable elements (such as
        names) so as to "anonymize" or "de-personalize" your information.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#636363">
        <strong><em>User Activity Information</em></strong>
        (hereinafter <strong>"UAI"</strong>) refers to information we collect about user activities on the Univision Interactive Network. For example, our web
        servers automatically collect and log "clickstream data" for all visitors to Univision.com, such as IP addresses (which are numerical numbers that are
        automatically assigned to users' computers and mobile devices when they are surfing the Internet), page requests, pages visited, content viewed, clicks and
        search queries made, etc. We also use cookies and similar technologies to collect UAI on the Univision Interactive Network (see <strong>Section 5</strong>
        below for more information). If and to the extent we use any UAI in a manner that identifies a specific user individually (e.g., if we link or associate
        such information with a user's name or address), it will be treated as PII. Otherwise, all UAI will be treated as AAI.

        <strong>2. <u>What We Do With the Information</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p style="color:#636363">
        As a general matter, we use information (PII and AAI) collected from and/or about our Audiences to improve our products and services so that they are
        appealing to as many people as possible, to administer and maintain operations of the Univision Interactive Network, to offer, market and advertise
        products and services (including those from third parties outside Univision with whom we do business (hereinafter referred to collectively as    <strong>"our Business Partners"</strong>)) to our Audiences, to administer and manage transactions and relationships with our Audiences, to personalize
        user experiences for our Audiences, and to build a strong community for our Audiences.

        <strong><u>2.1 Our Own Use of Information</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p style="color:#636363">
        <strong>2.1.1 Transactional, Administrative, and Customer Relation Purposes</strong>
        : If you provide information to us in connection with an Identification Activity, we will process and use your information for all purposes related to that
        activity, including communicating and interacting with you in relation to your activity. For example: (1) if you sign up for a product or service of the
        Univision Interactive Network, we will use your information to set up, administer, service, and communicate with you regarding, your account; (2) if you
        register to enter one of our contests or sweepstakes, we will use your information to process your entry and to conduct and administer the contest or
        sweepstake (including communicating with you in the event you are selected as a winner); (3) if you join one of our mailing or contact lists, we will use
        your information to send you or contact you with information that you have requested or that may be of interest to you; and (4) if you order a product or
        service from us, we will use your information to process and fulfill your order, to communicate with you regarding the same, and to provide customer
        service to you. Also, if you provide your email address or mailing address to us, we may use such address to send you notices of a transactional,
        administrative or relationship nature or as required by law, such as notification of a material change in this Privacy Policy and/or the Terms of Use for
        the Univision Interactive Network, notification of an actual or suspected security breach that affects your information stored by or for us, public
        relations announcements, etc.

        <strong>2.1.2 <u>Marketing &amp; Advertising Purposes</u>:</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="color:#636363">
        <strong>(1) Interest-based advertising on the Univision Interactive Network</strong>
        : We may use your PII and UAI to provide to you interest-based ads (i.e., ads potentially relevant or tailored to your interests) about products and
        services of Univision and/or our Business Partners. For example, we show ads inside and/or alongside the videos you watch on Univision.com. Sometimes,
        these ads are based on the topics or subject matters of the videos you are watching. However, to make these ads as relevant as possible for you, we may
        infer your viewing interests based on videos you have previously viewed on Univision.com, and may use this information to associate your browser with
        relevant interest categories and show you ads relevant to your inferred interests. For example, if your prior viewing habits on Univision.com suggest that
        you are a fan of a particular television show of Univision (e.g., if you often view video clips from that show on Univision.com), you may see more ads
        related to that show while on Univision.com. As another example, if you frequently view sports-related videos on Univision.com, we may associate a sports
        interest category with your browser and show you more sports-related ads when you are on Univision.com.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#636363">
        <strong>(2) Email marketing</strong>
        : If you provide your email address or mailing address to us (such as by joining one of our mailing lists), we may use such address to send you product and
        service offers, promotions, and advertisements from us and/or from our Business Partners. See <strong>Section 3.2</strong> below regarding how to opt out
        of our email marketing.

        and/or from our Business Partners. See <strong>Section 3.2</strong> below regarding how to opt out of our telemarketing.

    <p style="color:#636363">
        <strong>(4) Mobile marketing</strong>

        (Multimedia Message Service), etc., to your mobile device and/or (ii) send marketing and advertising emails to your wireless email account (e.g.,
        XYZ@att.mobile.net), to inform you about product/service offers, promotions, and advertisements from us and/or from our Business Partners. See    <strong>Section 3.2</strong> below regarding how to opt out of our mobile marketing (that is, if you wish to opt out of our further use of your information
        for mobile marketing after you have previously consented to such use).

Wireless service providers must add new domain names to this list within
        30 days of activating them. If your email address contains a domain name on this list (after the "@" symbol), then we will treat your email address as a
        wireless email address. However, the mere fact that you can retrieve emails from your regular Internet email accounton your mobile/wireless device, does
        not make your Internet email address a "wireless" email address.
