    Certain areas of the UNIVISION Community may have designated moderators that have certain responsibilities in connection with the operation of such areas
    (a "<strong>Moderator</strong>"). Moderators, as community leaders, should set good examples of responsible behavior for their groups, as demonstrated by
    their own behavior in the community. Each Moderator may, based on and consistent with the <strong>Terms of Use</strong>, determine the acceptable Content
    and behavior of their group and should notify us of any violations of the <strong>Terms of Use</strong>. No Moderator or group may sabotage or attempt to
    sabotage any other Moderator or group in any way, shape or form, and should not interfere with the operation of our Site or any Service. Violation of the
    foregoing may result in termination of the violator's community privileges. Being a Moderator does not create any affiliation, partnership, joint venture,
    employment, agency, representative, or other relationship with us or any Univision Entity, and we and the Univision Entities shall have no obligation or
    liability to Moderators or their groups in connection with their participation as such.
